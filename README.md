# connect-4
This is a personal project I started, inspired by what we had been doing in CS3500 (Object Oriented Design). I use MVC architecture to recreate Connect 4. At a high level it's the same as Marble Solitaire, but with a different model. I've also been working on adding new features (letting user play vs. the computer, 3 player game, etc.) while maintaining the SOLID design principles.
