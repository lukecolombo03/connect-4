Player (enum)

TODO:
-make an AI:
-add 3+ player capabilities (connect 4 modded ðŸ˜Ž)
-when you start the program, have an options menu where you can choose how many players,
if theres a bot, etc

Bot Strategy Priorities (in order):
1. Get 4 in a row
2. Block opponent from winning
3.

How to add a bot?
Have to change something in Controller.place()
Idk why the bot is just breaking the program now you can't place anything lol
